Quick intro to GitHub on Andorid Studio:
-Download the GH desktop app on your computer
-On the desktop app, click add a repository (the plus button) 
-Choose clone and select PostOpGo
-Now in Android Studio go to New->Project from Version Control->GitHub
-Pick PostOpGo

GIT IS COMPLICATED AND I'M STILL FIGURING OUT ANDROID STUDIO INTEGRATION MYSELF SO THIS WILL BE UPDATED 
ALSO, LATER WE SHOULD REPLACE THIS WITH A REAL README
